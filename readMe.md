Source code management is crucial for collaborative software development, enabling teams to work together efficiently, track changes, and maintain code integrity. 

Initialization:
This stage involves setting up the initial repository for the project.
Example: Creating a new repository on a platform like GitHub.

Development:
Developers work on adding features, fixing bugs, or making improvements to the codebase.
Example: Developers clone the repository to their local machines using Git, make changes to the code using their preferred IDE, and then commit those changes back to the repository.

Branching:
Branching allows developers to work on features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase.
Example: Creating feature branches or bug-fix branches from the main development branch (master or main).

Merging:
Merging integrates changes from one branch into another.
Example: Merging the changes made in the feature branch into the main branch once the feature is complete and tested.

Code Review:
Developers review each other's code to ensure quality, adherence to coding standards, and identify potential issues.
Example: Using pull requests (PRs) on platforms like GitHub to request reviews from team members before merging changes into the main branch.

Testing:
After changes are made, they need to be tested to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce regressions.
Example: Running unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like JUnit, Selenium, or PyTest.

Deployment:
Once changes have been tested and approved, they are deployed to production or staging environments.
Example: Using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the deployment process whenever changes are merged into the main branch.

Monitoring and Maintenance:
After deployment, it's important to monitor the application for issues and perform maintenance as needed.
Example: Using monitoring tools like Prometheus or New Relic to track application performance and respond to incidents promptly.

Documentation:
Documenting changes, features, and known issues helps maintain clarity and assists future development efforts.
Example: Updating README files, writing inline code comments, and maintaining project wikis with relevant information.
